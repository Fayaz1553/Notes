===============SPRING FRAMEWORK================

Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. It gets the information about the objects from a configuration file(XML) or Java Code or Java Annotations and Java POJO class. These objects are called Beans. Since the Controlling of Java objects and their lifecycle is not done by the developers, hence the name Inversion Of Control.

The followings are some of the main features of Spring IoC,
Creating Object for us,
Managing our objects,
Helping our application to be configurable,
Managing dependencies

There are 2 types of IoC containers: (The BeanFactory is the most basic version of IoC containers, and the ApplicationContext extends the features of BeanFactory.)
 - BeanFactory 
	BeanFactory factory = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("bean-factory-demo.xml");
 - ApplicationContext 
	ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("bean-factory-demo.xml");


Dependency Injection is the main functionality provided by Spring IOC(Inversion of Control). The Spring-Core module is responsible for injecting dependencies through either Constructor or Setter methods. The design principle of Inversion of Control emphasizes keeping the Java classes independent of each other and the container frees them from object creation and maintenance. With this we can achieve loose coupling.

Need for Dependency Injection:
Suppose class One needs the object of class Two to instantiate or operate a method, then class One is said to be dependent on class Two. Now though it might appear okay to depend a module on the other but, in the real world, this could lead to a lot of problems, including system failure. Hence such dependencies need to be avoided.
Spring IOC resolves such dependencies with Dependency Injection, which makes the code easier to test and reuse. Loose coupling between classes can be possible by defining interfaces for common functionality and the injector will instantiate the objects of required implementation.

There are two types of Spring Dependency Injection;
1) Setter Dependency Injection (SDI): This is the simpler of the two DI methods. In this, the DI will be injected with the help of setter and/or getter methods. Now to set the DI as SDI in the bean, it is done through the bean-configuration file For this, the property to be set with the SDI is declared under the <property> tag in the bean-config file.
    <bean id="GFG" class="com.geeksforgeeks.org.GFG"> 
        <property name="geek"> 
            <ref bean="CsvGFG" /> 
        </property> 
    </bean> 
---or---
<bean id="beanId" class="BeanClass"> 
  <property name="secondBean" ref="SecondBean"/> 
  <property name="message" value="This is message."/> 
</bean>
---or---
<bean id="beanId" class="BeanClass"> 
        <property name="name" value="geeks" /> 
        <property name="name2"> 
            <map> 
                <entry key="key1" value="value1"/> 	//for Maps
                <entry key ="key2" value-ref="DataSource"/> 
            </map> 
        </property> 
</bean>
---or---
<bean id="company" class="com.geeksforgeeks.org.Company">  
        <property name="companyName" value="GeeksForGeeks"></property>  
        <property name="employees">
            <list>
                 <value>"John"</value>		//for collections
                <value>"Max"</value>
                <value>"Sam"</value>
             </list>
         </property>
    </bean>  

2) Constructor Dependency Injection (CDI): In this, the DI will be injected with the help of contructors. Now to set the DI as CDI in bean, it is done through the bean-configuration file For this, the property to be set with the CDI is declared under the <constructor-arg> tag in the bean-config file.
<bean id="beanId" class="BeanClass"> 
  <constructor-arg type="String" value="test"/> 
  <constructor-arg type="int" value="1002"/> 
</bean>
---or---
<bean id="anyUniqueId" class="Student">
    <constructor-arg name="id" value="101"/>
    <constructor-arg name="mathCheat">
       <bean class="MathCheat"></bean>
    </constructor-arg>
</bean>
---or----
<bean id="mathCheatObjectValue" class="MathCheat"></bean>

<bean id="student" class="Student">
    <constructor-arg name="id" value="101"/>
    <constructor-arg name="mathCheat" ref="mathCheatObjectValue"/>
</bean>


key differences between constructor injection and setter injection
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Partial dependency --- can be injected using setter injection but it is not possible by constructor. Suppose there are 3 properties in a class, having 3 arg constructor and setters methods. In such case, if you want to pass information for only one property, it is possible by setter method only.
Overriding --- Setter injection overrides the constructor injection. If we use both constructor and setter injection, IOC container will use the setter injection.
New Instances --- We can easily change the value by setter injection. It doesn't create a new bean instance always like constructor. So setter injection is flexible than constructor injection.


POM --> Project Object Model
POJO --> Plain Old Java Object

bean scopes - refers to the lifecycle of Bean
-------------
1) Singleton ---> (default)spring container creates only one instance of bean definition per Spring IoC container(shared among all beans of same type) 
	<beans>
  	   < bean id = "hw" class= "bean.HelloWorld" scope = "singleton" / >
	</beans>
2) Prototype ---> A new instance will be created for a single bean definition every time a request is made for that bean.
	<beans>
  	   < bean id = "hw" class= "bean.HelloWorld" scope = "prototype" / >
	</beans>
3) request ---> A new instance will be created for a single bean definition every time an HTTP request is made for that bean. But Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
4) session ---> Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of an HTTP Session. But Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
5) global-session --> Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a global HTTP Session. It is also only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.


bean configuration(3 ways)
--------------------------
1. XML configuration  ---> ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
2. Anotation configuration --> @Component for which we want the bean & write component-scan in xml or in java config class
3. Java configuration --> @Configuration, @Bean --> AnnotationConfigApplicationContext


xml config
-----------
IOC
<bean id=" " class=" " scope=" "></bean>

DI
<bean id=" " class=" " scope="sigleton/prototype" autowired="byName/byType etc">	//in case of autowired, no need to mention setter/costructor inj.
	<property name=" " value=" " (or) ref=" " />	//setter injection
	<contructor-arg name=" " value=" " type=" "(or) ref=" " />  //contructor injection
</bean>


annotation config
------------------
IOC
@component
<component-scan> in xml file or java config class

DI
@component
<component-scan> in xml file or java config
@Autowired	//to inject dependency of another class (to use autowired, bean has to created for that obj in xml or java config or mention @component for that class)
@Primary or @Qualifier(" ") 	//to remove ambiguity if there r multiple implimentations for interface --> ClassPathXmlApplicationContext


java config
------------
IOC
@configuration //config class is created
@bean (no need to create @component for the classes to which bean in created in config class)

DI
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(base-packages=" ")
@Bean
@Autowired	//used to inject the object dependency implicitly. It internally uses setter or constructor injection. Autowiring can't be used to inject primitive and string values. It works with reference only.
@Qualifier(" ")


Autowire:
---------
- No -> tells the framework that autowiring is not supposed to be done. It is the default mode used by Spring
- byName -> It uses the name of the bean for injecting dependencies
- byType -> It injects the dependency according to the type of the bean. It looks up in the configuration file for the class type of the property. If it finds a bean that matches, it injects the property. If not, the program throws an error.
- constructor -> It injects the required dependencies by invoking the constructor. It works similar to the “byType” mode but it looks for the class type of the constructor arguments. If none or more than one bean are detected, then it throws an error
- autoDetect -> uses two other modes for autowiring – constructor and byType. It first tries to autowire via the constructor mode and if it fails, it uses the byType mode for autowiring.




===============SPRING BOOT================

Spring Boot is an open-source Java framework that makes developing web applications and microservices faster and easier. It is a combination of Spring Framework and Embedded Servers. The main goal of Spring Boot is to reduce development, unit test, and integration test time. With Spring Boot, you can concentrate on business aspects rather than infrastructure.
Spring Boot Advantages
	It Create stand-alone Spring applications
	It also minimizes writing multiple boilerplate codes, XML configuration, and annotations (There is no need for XML configuration.)
	It easily tests web applications using several Embedded HTTP servers like as Tomcat, Jetty etc.
	It Provides ‘starter’ dependencies to simplify the build configuration.
	It includes features that are ready for production such as metrics, health checks and externalised settings.

Spring Initializer is a Web-based tool that generates the Spring Boot project structure.

The spring boot follows a layered architecture in which each layer communicates to other layers
The spring boot consists of the following four layers:
1.Presentation Layer – Authentication & converting the JSON field’s parameter to Java Objects and vice-versa.
2.Business Layer – contains all the business logic. It consists of service classes. It is responsible for validation and authorization.
3.Persistence Layer – contains all the database storage logic. It is responsible for converting business objects to the database row and vice-versa.
4.Database Layer – Actual Database. It is responsible for performing the CRUD operations.

FLOW:
Client--->Controller<--->Service lyr<--->Dao lyr<--->DB
  |		|
  <--Jsp pages<--

The default port of the Tomcat server is 8080 and can be changed in the application.properties file.

application.properties
----------------------
server.pot=8585
coach.name=Fayaz
team.name=MI
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=* 	//expose all acutator endpoints over HTTP

-----inside RestController----
@Value("${coach.name}")
private String Coach;

@Value("${team.name}")
private String Team;
---also as below ---
@Value("Anshul")
    public void setName(String name)    // Setter
    {
        this.name = name;
    }


Query parameters are appended to the end of the request URL, following ? and listed in key value pairs, separated by &
	•  syntax:  ?id=1&type=new
Path parameters form part of the request URL, and are referenced using placeholders preceded by : 
	•  syntax:  /customer/:id


Dependencies
------------
spring-boot-starter-web //contains spring-web,web-mvc,rest,hibernate,tomcat etc
spring-boot-devtools //used to automatically reload our appllication whenever code is updates
spring-boot-starter-acutator //used to monitor & manage our application, check app's health,access metrics(The default endpoint is ‘localhost:8080/actuator’. By deafult /health & /info are available prefixed by /acutator, To add/include all ID/endpoints about your application you can do it in application.properties by following – management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*)
h2 // it is an open-source lightweight Java database.
‘Lombok’ dependency  // it is used to reduce boilerplate code for model/data objects. like, @Data annotation is a shortcut annotation and bundles @ToString, @Getter, @Setter, @EqualsAndHashCode and @RequiredArgsConstructor annotations into a single annotation to reduce boilerplate code. @NoArgsConstructor annotation is used to generate a constructor with no arguments. @AllArgsConstructor annotation is used to generate a parameterized constructor which accepts a single parameter for each field and initializes them using it.


Annotations
------------
@Autowired -> It injects object dependency implicitly. We use @Autowired to mark the dependency that will be injected by the Spring container. It is applied to the fields, setter methods, and constructors.
@SpringBootApplication -> It is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application. It is the combination of  @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan annotations.
@EnableAutoConfiguration -> is used to enable the auto-configuration feature. It automatically registers the beans with @Component, @Configuration, @Bean that are present in the classpath.
@Controller -> it indicates that they’re front controllers and responsible to handle user requests and return the appropriate response. It is typically used in combination with annotated handler methods based on the @RequestMapping annotation. It can be applied to classes only. It’s used to mark a class as a web request handler
@RestController -> specifies that this class is a controller for RESTful API requests.
@RequestMapping -> specifies the base URL for all requests handled by this controller.
@Service -> to indicate that they’re holding the business logic(service layer). Spring will create an instance of it automatically.
@Repository -> to indicate that they’re dealing with CRUD operations, usually, it’s used with DAO (Data Access Object) or Repository implementations that deal with database tables. Spring will create an instance of it automatically. 
@Configuration -> indicates that the class has @Bean definition methods. So Spring container can process the class and generate Spring Beans to be used in the application.
@Bean -> is applied on a method to specify that it returns a bean to be managed by Spring context. Spring Bean annotation is usually declared in Configuration classes methods. Whenever you are using the @Bean annotation to create the bean you don’t need to use the @ComponentScan annotation inside your configuration class.
@ComponentScan -> is used along with the @Configuration annotation to specify the packages that we want to be scanned, becoz we dont want to use beans.xml. Spring can also start scanning from the specified package, which we can define using basePackageClasses() or basePackages(). If no package is specified, then it considers the package of the class declaring the @ComponentScan annotation.
@Component -> it is a class-level annotation. It is used to denote a class as a Component(bean). We can use @Component across the application to mark the beans as Spring’s managed components
@Qualifier-> is used to resolve the autowiring conflict when there are multiple beans of the same type. The @Qualifier annotation can be used on any class annotated with @Component or on methods annotated with @Bean.
@Primary -> it indicates that a particular bean should be given preference when multiple beans are candidates to be autowired to a single-valued dependency.  
@Value -> is used to assign default values to variables and method arguments. We can read spring environment variables as well as system variables using this annotation.
@PostConstruct -> it gets executed after the spring bean is initialized. We can have only one method annotated with this  annotation.
@PreDestroy -> it gets called when the bean instance is getting removed from the context. Remember that if your spring bean scope is “prototype” then it’s not completely managed by the spring container and the PreDestroy method won’t get called.
@Scope -> to set bean scope
@Required -> is a method-level annotation used in the setter method of a bean property and therefore making the setter-injection compulsory. This annotation suggests that the required bean property must be injected with a value at the configuration time & shouldn't be null.

@PathVariable(String id) -> it takes variable from url path & assign to a variable 
@RequestBody(LoginForm logForm) -> takes Json data/HttpRequest body from client and assigns it to respective Object by deserialization.
@ResponseBody() -> tells a controller that the object returned is automatically serialized into JSON and passed back into the HttpResponse object.
@RestController -> is used for making restful web services. It is combination of the @controller and @ResponseBody. This annotation is used at the class level and allows the class to handle the requests made by the client.

@Entity -> specifies that this class is an entity and should be mapped to a database table.
@Table -> specifies the name of the database table that will store instances of this entity.
@Id -> specifies a field in a model class as the primary key
@GeneratedValue -> specifies that the primary key should be generated automatically.
@Column - > represents a column

@EnableScheduling -> It facilitates Spring Boot with scheduled task execution capability
@Scheduled  -> for scheduling a task 
@ExceptionHandler
@ControllerAdvice (AOP) //for global exception handler


Spring data rest ---->no need of controller and services //search for more info  
Spring Data JDBC -->Spring Data JDBC is a POJO class. @Table, @ID, and @Column annotations are helpful to mention for direct connection with the database. (for normal Spring JDBC we dont have anotations and Id, column names should match with names in DB)

JPA(Java Persistence API)
-------------------------
Standard API for ORM
NO VENDOR LOCK-IN 

In springBoot, Hibernate is the default impl of JPA
SpringBoot automatically creates datasource and Entitymanager
---> Entity Manager is from JPA.Its is similar to Session factory

@Transactional is not needed in Spring Data JPA, it provides it by default


Data binding
-------------
It is the process of converting JSON data to and from java POJO's

@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)  //to ignore additional changes in json that pojo class unware to avoid exceptions


Jackson
--------
jackson handles the data binding b/w JSON and Java POJO's internally in Spring Boot. In others we have to add Jackson-databind dependency

Rest over Http methods(CRUD operations)
--------------------------
POST ---- CREATE
GET ---- READ
PUT ---- UPDATE
DELETE --- DELETE






===============SPRING MVC================

Spring MVC is a Model View, and Controller based web framework widely used to develop web applications. Spring MVC framework enables the separation of modules namely Model View, Controller, and seamlessly handles the application integration.
Model – A model can be an object or collection of objects which basically contains the data of the application.
View – A view is used for displaying the information to the user in a specific format. Spring supports various technologies like freemarker, velocity, and thymeleaf.
Controller – It contains the logical part of the application. @Controller annotation is used to mark that class as a controller.
Front Controller – It remains responsible for managing the flow of the web application. Dispatcher Servlet acts as a front controller in Spring MVC.

DispatcherServlet acts as the Front Controller for Spring-based web applications.Any request is going to come into our website the front controller is going to stand in front and is going to accept all the requests and once the front controller accepts that request then this is the job of the front controller that it will make a decision that who is the right controller to handle that request.

In Spring, the /WEB-INF/web.xml file is the Web Application Deployment Descriptor of the application. This file is an XML document that defines everything about your application that a server needs to know (except the context path, which is assigned by the Application Deployer and Administrator when the application is deployed), servlets, and other components like filters or listeners, initialization parameters, container-managed security constraints, resources, welcome pages, etc. 
WEB-INF/web.xml
{servlet name}-servlet.xml

<servlet>
    <servlet-name>myDispatcherServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
    <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
 
<servlet-mapping>
    <!-- Provide a Servlet Name that you want to map -->
    <servlet-name>myDispatcherServlet</servlet-name>
    <!-- Provide a url pattern -->
    <url-pattern>/gfg.com/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

So this does mean that the servlet “myDispatcherServlet” is going to handle all the requests starting from gfg.com/anything, that may be gfg.com/save or gfg.com/get, anything. But it must start with gfg.com.

---or---
//class needs to implement WebApplicationInitializer
AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext webApplicationContext  = new AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext();
 
        // Registering the spring config class
        webApplicationContext.register(CalculatorAppConfig.class);
 
        // Creating a dispatcher servlet object
        DispatcherServlet dispatcherServlet = new DispatcherServlet(webApplicationContext);

---or---
//class needs to extend AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer, it has below methods.
public class CalculatorAppInitializer
    extends AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer {
 
    @Override protected Class<?>[] getRootConfigClasses()
    {
        return null;
    }

//need to overrride this, to register the spring config class
    @Override protected Class<?>[] getServletConfigClasses()
    {
	Class aClass[] = { CalculatorAppConfig.class };
        return aClass;
    }

//need to overrride this, mapping for the dispatcher servlet
    @Override protected String[] getServletMappings()
    {
	String arr[] = { "/gfg.com/*" };
        return arr;
    }
}


methodname(HttpServletRequest req, )
-----------------------------------
String str=req.getParameter("");
int i= Integer.ParseInt(req.getParameter("name of var in jsp feilds"));
-or-
methodname(@RequestParam("name of var in jsp feilds") String str ) //reads parametrs from form data and bind it to str variable 


methodname(, Model theModel)  // used to pass data btw controller to views
----------------------------
theModel.addAttribute("attribute name", attribute value);
-or-
methodname(@ModelAtrribute("name of modelAtrribute in jsp form") Student thestudent) //it binds form data to obj
										     //it fetches all feilds of an obj
